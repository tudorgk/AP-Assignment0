AP-Assignment0 - Look at Those Curves
=====================================

SYNOPSIS
--------

The objective of this assignment is to gain hands-on programming experience with Haskell.

The goal is to implement a library, Curves, for working with piecewise linear curves in the plane (based on an idea by Hansen and Rischel, who in turn got the idea from Maarten M. Fokkinga).
